    <br>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pancetta primavera rigatoni really is a tremendous bowl of pasta. Thanks to the pancetta, it's rich and decadent, but thanks to all the herbs and veggies, it's also fresh and vibrant.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>8 ounces pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>8 ounces mezzi rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup shelled fresh English peas</li>
        <li>1 cup asparagus, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian parsley leaves</li>
        <li>1 cup basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed mint leaves</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Pecorino cheese, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of the olive oil to a large pan, and set heat to medium. Add diced pancetta, and cook, stirring occasionally, until pancetta is browned, and most of the fat has rendered out, 7 to 10 minutes. Turn off heat.</li>
        <li>Remove some pancetta and reserve to garnish the top if desired. Pour out some of the excess pancetta fat from the pan if desired, but leaving at least 2 or 3 tablespoons. </li>
        <li>Add green onions, and turn heat to medium-low. Sauté green onions for a few minutes to soften slightly, then turn off heat and reserve until pasta is cooked.</li>
        <li>While pancetta is cooking, bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add rigatoni, and set a timer for 2 minutes less than recommended cooking time for the pasta, or about 7 minutes for mezzi rigatoni. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine parsley, basil, mint, garlic, lemon juice, and water in the jar of a blender or a cup; blend in the blender or with an immersion blender until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>When timer rings, stir in asparagus and peas and continue cooking for 2 minutes, or until pasta is done to your liking. Use a strainer to transfer pasta and vegetables into the pan with pancetta. </li>
        <li>Turn heat to medium-low and pour in herb mixture. Stir until combined. Season with salt, and drizzle in about 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add about 1/4 cup pasta water, and stir over medium-low heat until everything is hot.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat, and stir in cheese. Taste for seasoning, and serve immediately. Garnish with more cheese, reserved pancetta, and more sliced green onions.</li>
